# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Remembering back from the notes i took, git is the technology aspect or the (tool). GitHub is a website that receives and stores the code or information. 

  Researched answer: Git is the tool that i mentioned in my answer that can have an unlimited amount of versions of code. GitHub is mainly used for sending repositories and updating them constantly, especially when i am pair programming.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: From what i remember and the notes i took, a Boolean value is an expression that will return a true or false expression in your code.

  Researched answer: After researching, i found that the value of true of false in a boolean is a word they are not strings and only give the value of true of false.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Index is where the location of a character is placed in a string. The main difference between and index and a value is that an index is where the string will be placed which is in a string. The value is what is the items of the element.

  Researched answer: I stated in my answer that an index is where the location of a character is placed in a string but after researching i found that it can also be an element in an array.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: I remember learning about iteration from our lecture that covered Javascript loops. Iteration is when a certain block of code is ran over and over until one thing is met which is the condition. 

  Researched answer: I learned that iterations are used in many computer languages and programs to perform important and specific task, complete problem solving, and when the iteration is complete it will give a solution to the user. A very common form of iteration is commonly referred to as a loop.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: From my experience using pair programming for the past week, pair programming is when two or more users code while only using one source of code and every user is contributing. There are two roles while pair programming which are drivers and navigators. The driver is the only one that has hands on the keyboard during the collaboration. The navigator roles is to observe what the driver is doing and also doing all of the thinking.

  Researched answer: After researching i forgot to mention that  the driver is the person who is managing the editor. The navigator is in charge of the advising portion of the collaboration. One of the most important roles of the navigator is input to the code that is more thought out. The navigator is also responsible for being alert and noticing errors.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: are methods in Javascript that are built in that act on arrays. Higher order functions have a similarity to strings and arrays in which they can be assigned to variables.

2. Jest: after researching, jests are tests used in JavaScript which is tasked with making sure any JavaScript codebase is correct.

3. Objects: are a data type in JavaScript have key: value pairs. Objects can also be a single index of the array.

4. Method: are actions that can be performed on objects and is a property that contains a definition of a function.

5. Classes: are different types of functions that contain data. Similar to functions, classes contain their own scope. Classes are also a main blueprint for objects.
